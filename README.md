# Biometric Recognition Toolkit

## Overview

Welcome to the Biometric Recognition Toolkit, a comprehensive Python-based suite designed to facilitate biometric recognition tasks. Leveraging powerful libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image, and pickle, this toolkit provides robust tools for fingerprint, voice, and face recognition. This project aims to offer an accessible, flexible, and efficient solution for implementing biometric recognition systems.
